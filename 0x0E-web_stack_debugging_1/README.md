Nginx is an open-source web server that also functions as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. It is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption. Nginx is widely used to serve static content, handle high loads, and manage multiple tasks efficiently

Using your debugging skills, find out what’s keeping your Ubuntu container’s Nginx installation from listening on port 80. Feel free to install whatever tool you need, start and destroy as many containers as you need to debug the issue. Then, write a Bash script with the minimum number of commands to automate your fix.

Requirements:

Nginx must be running, and listening on port 80 of all the server’s active IPv4 IPs
Write a Bash script that configures a server to the above requirements
