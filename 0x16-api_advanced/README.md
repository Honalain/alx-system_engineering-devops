How to Read API Documentation to Find the Endpoints You’re Looking For
Understand the Structure: API documentation typically includes sections like authentication, endpoints, request parameters, and response formats. Familiarize yourself with this structure to navigate efficiently.
Search for Endpoints: Look for a section labeled “Endpoints” or “Resources.” This is where you’ll find the available actions, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, each associated with a specific URL.
Review Example Requests: Most documentation includes example requests. This helps you understand the endpoint's purpose and how to use it.
Check Parameters and Responses: For each endpoint, check what parameters are required or optional and what kind of response you’ll get. Look for examples of JSON or XML responses to understand the structure of the data returned.
How to Use an API with Pagination
Identify Pagination Parameters: In the API documentation, look for parameters like page, limit, offset, or cursor. These control pagination.
Make Initial Request: Start by making a request with default pagination parameters (e.g., page=1 or limit=10).
Handle Paginated Responses: Check the response for fields indicating the next page, such as next_page, next_url, or pagination.
Iterate Over Pages: Use a loop to make requests for each page until you reach the end (when next_page or similar is null or missing).
How to Parse JSON Results from an API
Make an API Request: Use an HTTP library (like requests in Python) to make a request to the API.
Parse the JSON Response:
In Python, use response.json() to parse the JSON into a Python dictionary.
In JavaScript, use response.json() after fetching data to convert it into a JavaScript object.
Access Data: Once parsed, access the data using keys in the dictionary or object, depending on the structure of the JSON.
How to Make a Recursive API Call
Initial Request: Make your initial API call.
Check for Continuation Condition: After receiving the response, check if there’s a need to make another call (e.g., more pages to retrieve).
Recursive Function: Define a function that calls itself if more data needs to be fetched.
