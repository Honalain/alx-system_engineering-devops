A web server's primary role is to serve web pages to clients over the internet or an intranet.
It processes incoming network requests over HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and several other related protocols.
When a client (typically a web browser) requests a resource such as an HTML page, image, or other types of files, the web server retrieves the requested resource and sends it back to the client.
