This 0x0A. Configuration management project from ALX SE.
Puppet is a tool used in IT and software development for managing and automating the setup and maintenance of computer systems and software.
Imagine you have a lot of computers (servers) that need to be set up or updated in a certain way, like installing software or configuring settings.
Doing this manually on each computer can be time-consuming and error-prone.
Puppet helps automate this process, ensuring everything is configured correctly and consistently across all systems.
