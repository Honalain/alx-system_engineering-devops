Website Outage Due to DNS Misconfiguration
Issue Summary
•	Duration: August 15, 2024, from 02:30 AM to 04:00 AM UTC (1 HOURS).
•	Impact: The primary e-commerce platform was completely inaccessible to users. 100% of the users were affected, resulting in potential revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction.
•	Root Cause: A misconfigured DNS record during a routine update caused the website’s domain to become unreachable.

Timeline
•	02:30 AM: Monitoring alert triggered, indicating that the website was down.
•	02:32 AM: On-call engineer receives an alert and begins initial investigation by checking server statuses.
•	02:35 AM: The engineer confirms that all servers are running but notices no incoming traffic.
•	02:40 AM: Escalation to the network team due to suspicion of network-level issues.
•	02:45 AM: The network team checks the firewall and load balancers, finding no anomalies.
•	02:50 AM: Misleading hypothesis considered that an internal firewall might be blocking traffic.
•	03:00 AM: The DNS configuration is reviewed, and it is discovered that a recent DNS record update is missing the correct A record.
•	03:05 AM: The missing A record is corrected and propagated.
•	03:15 AM: DNS changes begin to propagate, and some users regain access.
•	03:45 AM: Majority of users are able to access the website again.
•	04:00 AM: Full recovery confirmed with all users having access.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The issue was caused by a misconfiguration in the DNS records during a routine update. Specifically, an A record pointing to the website’s IP address was accidentally deleted, which resulted in the domain becoming unreachable. As DNS is a crucial component for domain name resolution, the absence of this record meant that any attempt to access the website resulted in a failure to resolve the domain to the corresponding IP address, effectively taking the website offline.
Resolution:
The resolution involved identifying the missing DNS A record and promptly restoring it. Once the correct DNS configuration was applied, the changes were propagated across DNS servers globally. Since DNS propagation can take time, a partial recovery was observed within 10 minutes, with full recovery confirmed after 45 minutes. The website was fully accessible by 04:00 AM UTC.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
•	DNS Change Management: Implement stricter controls and peer reviews for any DNS updates to prevent accidental misconfigurations.
•	Monitoring Enhancements: Improve monitoring to include checks on DNS records and instant alerts for missing or incorrect configurations.
•	Documentation: Create detailed documentation and a checklist for DNS changes to ensure all steps are correctly followed.
Tasks:
1.	Patch DNS Server: Review and patch the DNS server configurations to ensure robust fallback mechanisms.
2.	Add DNS Monitoring: Implement real-time monitoring on DNS records to detect and alert any missing or misconfigured records instantly.
3.	Update Change Management Protocol: Enhance the change management process to include mandatory peer review for DNS updates.
4.	Conduct Training: Organize a training session for engineers on the importance of DNS and best practices for updating DNS records.
5.	Backup DNS Configuration: Create automated backups of DNS configurations before any changes are applied to allow quick rollbacks if needed.
By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, ensuring the reliability and availability of our services.
