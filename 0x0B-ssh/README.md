A server is a computer that provides information to other computers called "clients" on computer network.[1] This architecture is called the clientâ€“server model.
Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients or performing computations for a client.
A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers.
