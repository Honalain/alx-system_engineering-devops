This task for 0x0D. Web stack debugging

In this first debugging project, you will need to get Apache to run on the container and to return a page containing Hello Holberton when querying the root of it.
In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given to you, the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state. But before writing this Bash script, you should figure out what is going on and fix it manually.
