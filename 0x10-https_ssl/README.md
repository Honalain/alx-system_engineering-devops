0x10. HTTPS SSL This project 

An SSL connection sends encrypted data between an end user's computer and the web server through a certificate for authentication. The SSL termination helps speed up the decryption process and reduces the processing load on the back-end servers.
What is the purpose encrypting traffic?

Strong encryption is critical to protecting sensitive business and personal data. Encrypted network traffic cannot be accessed by attackers and provides no benefit to them. Encrypting data as it moves over a network is only part of a comprehensive network data encryption strategy.

What SSL termination means

SSL termination is a process by which SSL-encrypted data traffic is decrypted (or offloaded). Servers with a secure socket layer (SSL) connection can simultaneously handle many connections or sessions. An SSL connection sends encrypted data between an end-userâ€™s computer and web server by using a certificate for authentication. SSL termination helps speed the decryption process and reduces the processing burden on backend servers.
